The code for this problem is very poorly written, I know.
I spent some time trying to read the tree the same way the 
leetCode problem intends.
The function works for what I tested.
I tried uploading it to leetCode, but the memory limit is exceeded.

I have a lot to learn from this, most importantly is writing better code
and thinking of better ways to solve the problems.

Hopefully down the road there will be a big improvement in the solutions
for the problems.
